# Car Evolution Timeline

This is a basic web application that displays important milestones in the history of car development, from the early 1900s to the late 1970s. The project presents events in a timeline format using simple HTML.

### Description:

In this stage, the basic structure of the timeline is created using HTML. It includes:

- A header with a logo and a theme toggle button
- A navigation section with links to different years
- A main timeline section where car history events are displayed
- A modal section for additional details (empty for now)
- A footer for basic copyright

This stage does not include any styling or interactive features. It focuses only on the layout and content.
